Layli Long Soldier's "Three" challenges what it means to manipulate
form. "Three" consists of four sentences oriented at right angles to
each other, forming a square and thus rejecting an easily identifiable
beginning and end. These sentences themselves are not punctuated and are
often interrupted with irregular spacing. My verbal description cannot
suffice -- the poem is highly spatial and experiential in a way that
asks us to engage with it firsthand. With its sentences of varying
orientation (which make it nearly impossible to reproduce here), it asks
us to rotate the page and crane our necks in order to read it.

Thus the poem stretches form to its boundaries and seems to be in
constant cyclical motion as each sentence endlessly flows into the next,
closely resembling but varying each other in such a way as to make it
unclear what the "original" sentence is. But in each sentence appear the
words "place" and "space", invoking the literal and figurative
containment, enclosure, and marginalization of indigenous peoples in a
settler-colonial society. Soldier's poem invites us to *experience* the
historical and ongoing containment of indigenous peoples while at the
same time "*unsettling* the logics of containment" in critic Mishuana
Goeman's words.

Goeman argues that rather than assuming the meaning of the word "land",
we should put it under scrutiny. Land "is a keyword with much currency
... \[it\] is often conflated in indigenous studies to mean landscape,
place, territory, home, or all or some of these simultaneously. *Land*,
in this sense, carries a very important and heavy workload" (Goeman 71).
For Goeman, clarifying what land should mean is crucial because one
result of colonialism is a "translation or too easy collapsing of *land*
to *property*, a move that perpetuates the logics of containment"
(Goeman 72).

Start by contextualizing the problem of land -- its importance to
indigenous communities, the importance of thinking of land as more than
property, what is at stake in such a conflation of land and property,
then introduce Soldier's poem in this context as thinking about
containment, space, land, ownership, escape, perception, resistance,
etc.

why it's important to define land -- because it's NOT property, not
merely possession, not linear -- then outline the stakes of that
collapsing to property

connection rather than differentiation -- identity, property as being
differentiating

then locate Soldier's poem at this site of rethinking the logics of
containment
