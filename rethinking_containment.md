Rethinking Containment

Layli Long Soldier's "Three" challenges what it means to manipulate
form. "Three" consists of four sentences oriented at right angles to
each other, forming a square and thus rejecting an easily identifiable
beginning and end. These sentences themselves are not punctuated and are
often interrupted with irregular spacing. My verbal description cannot
suffice -- the poem is highly spatial and experiential in a way that
asks us to engage with it firsthand. With its sentences of varying
orientation (which make it nearly impossible to reproduce here), it asks
us to rotate the page and crane our necks in order to read it.

Thus the poem stretches form to its boundaries and seems to be in
constant cyclical motion as each sentence endlessly flows into the next,
closely resembling but varying the last in such a way as to make it
unclear what the "original" sentence is. But in each sentence appear the
words "place" and "space", invoking the literal and figurative
containment, enclosure, and marginalization of indigenous peoples in a
settler-colonial society. Soldier's poem invites us to *experience* the
historical and ongoing containment of indigenous peoples while at the
same time "*unsettling* the logics of containment" in critic Mishuana
Goeman's words.

Goeman argues that rather than assuming the meaning of the word "land",
we should put it under scrutiny. Land "is a keyword with much currency
... \[it\] is often conflated in indigenous studies to mean landscape,
place, territory, home, or all or some of these simultaneously. *Land*,
in this sense, carries a very important and heavy workload" (Goeman 71).
For Goeman, clarifying what land should mean is crucial because one
result of colonialism is a "translation or too easy collapsing of *land*
to *property*, a move that perpetuates the logics of containment"
(Goeman 72). Viewing land as a "linear time construct marked by supposed
shifting ownerships" bolsters "imperial geographies that order time and
space in hierarchies that erase and bury indigenous connections to place
and anesthetize settler-colonial histories" (Goeman 74). To elaborate, a
linear conception of land is one that forever moves forward, privileging
the present and the future over the past. Such a conception thus rapidly
dissolves the memory of a violent colonial past. Further, the "shifting
ownerships" in this conception work to destabilize the land, making it
easy to claim, to possess, and to define merely by possession. Goeman
suggests that we should instead be "conceiving of space as a node rather
than a linear time construct," and that we should define culture and
land as "meaning making rather than as differentiation and isolation in
a multicultural neoliberal model...a claimed object" (Goeman 74, 72).
After all, our society's conception of land is one that flattens its
multidimensional qualities into pure differentiation, temporal and
spatial: leases are marked with a start and an end, while lots are
contained within well-defined borders. In general, Goeman advocates for
an approach that emphasizes a flowing in rather than fading away, a
"connection rather than differentiation", one that relates "both
personal and communal experiences and histories to certain locations and
landscapes" (Goeman 74, 73). Soldier's poem confronts, critiques, and
resists our current way of viewing land, aiming to "unsettle the logics
of containment" and to move towards a less reductive and essentializing
conception of land.

Soldier appropriates the form and shape of containment through creating
a square poem, at once depicting and subverting it. We cannot speak of a
beginning; the squareness of the poem ensures a linear reading and
rejects an identification of start and end. Thus Soldier has taken the
square, a shape associated with and used to enact containment (through
allotment of reservation land, for example), to then reject the linear
logics of containment mentioned above that erase violent histories of
colonial dispossession. By refusing a linear conception of time and
space, Soldier thus invokes space as a node, remembering and
incorporating the violence of dispossession into the poem instead of
moving past it and leaving it behind. The reader must rotate the poem in
order for the four sentences to be legible, but in forcing the reader to
accept the four inward-facing sentences, Soldier contains and detains
the reader inside the walls of text. The North-oriented line reads as
follows:

"This is how you see me the space in which to place me"

Here the verb form of "place" is used, perhaps referencing forced
containment and suggesting that the "me" of the poem is an indigenous
subject and the "you" is a member of the colonizing society, since the
speaker has passively been placed. Thus, the colonizer is indicted of
containing the indigenous subject, while simultaneously *being*
contained in a reversal of roles. Locked in the tangible box of the
poem, the colonial gaze is reversed. The colonial gaze is far from one
of neutral observation: I am reminded of Sarah (Saartjie) Baartman, the
South African Khoikhoi woman who was put on exhibition in 1810 London
for her large buttocks where "men and women of Britain's upper crust
gawked at, prodded, and squeezed these so-called human freaks" (Elkins).
The gaze upon Baartman was "a symbol of the alienation and degradations
of colonization... the expropriation of female labor and the sexual and
economic exploitation of black women by men," in English professor
Rachel Holmes's words (Elkins). The speaker in "Three", by containing
their colonizer within the poem, also puts them up for display, forcing
them to reckon with the legacy and ongoing effects of their colonial
gaze. The containment of the colonizer within the poem also bears an
uncanny resemblance to the opening of one of Terrance Hayes's poems
entitled "American Sonnet for my Past and Future Assassin:" "I lock you
in an American sonnet that is part prison, / Part panic closet, a little
room in a house set aflame" (Hayes). Both poets remember a past (and
future) containment and solidify their agency and subjectivity by
reversing its direction. Hayes achieves this through a tone that one
might use to cast a spell (at once descriptive and imperative), while
Soldier achieves this through a physical enactment of containment by
manipulating the poem's form.

To access the content of the North-oriented line, we must first accept
the poem's complete lack of punctuation. Punctuation serves to divide,
to demarcate, and to signal relations between words, so it is not
surprising that it is omitted in a poem about containment. Perhaps
punctuation in this context is too limiting as it flattens out the
multidimensional meanings of a sequence of words into a single
interpretation, prescribing one way of reading a sentence. Regardless,
in this line, there must be some sort of division between "me" and "the
space", indicating that the speaker is somehow reduced to the space in
which they have been placed. This line relates to Goeman's issues with
the status quo conception of land: if land collapses into merely
ownership and possession, what becomes of those contained *in* the land?
Are they merely static parts of the landscape? If land is defined by the
people who possess it, is it not the case that only those who own land
can be considered people? We need to look no further than slavery and
alien land laws "\[prohibiting\] land ownership by residents who were
ineligible \[for\] citizenship" whose aim was "clearly the
disenfranchisement of non-white immigrants" in order to confirm this
(Grant). Through the "first" line of "Three," we thus understand that
the degradation of the concept of land into possessed property provides
ground for equating "human" with "land-owning," an equation that both
enables and justifies the dehumanization of those forcibly dispossessed
of their land. Perhaps the indigenous speaker places a semi-colon in the
middle of this line, conveying a matter-of-fact recognition of the
colonizer's logic: "This is how you see me; the space in which to place
me". But due to the lack of punctuation, we can simultaneously hear the
speaker's indignant tone as they interrogate their colonizer, whom they
have contained within the poem, subjected to their gaze, and forced to
be on the receiving end of their own dehumanizing logic: "This is how
you see me? The space in which to place me?" The lack of punctuation
therefore allows for a multitude of tones at once, echoing within the
enclosed space of the poem.

If in the North-oriented line, the space is conflated with the speaker,
it is incorporated within the speaker in the East-oriented line:

"The space in me you see is this place"

The "space in me you see" suggests a certain emptiness, and one visible
to the colonizer. But if the speaker has indeed contained the colonizer
within the poem, it is as if the colonizer has been transported to the
speaker's interior. Incorporating the "space" from the previous line,
the speaker thus subsumes and further entraps the colonizer.
Interestingly, performing this entrapment in turn frees the speaker:
before the speaker was located within the space, but now the space is
inside the speaker. If we turn again to the question of punctuation,
perhaps the abundant whitespace following "see" suggests we place a
comma after it, which might be paired with another comma as follows:
"The space in me, you see, is this place." This creates a didactic tone,
which invokes the classroom and the relation between instructor and
student. But the classroom was a site of indigenous containment:
"Boarding schools were part of the colonial making of place and an
alienation of the body from land as a life blood...They were deeply
concerned with disciplining bodies, distancing indigenous people from
land, and destroying the cultural ways that nurtured relationship to
land and their communities" (Goeman 81). The boarding school served as
mode of containment which was not just enclosed but also removed and
displaced. By assuming a didactic tone, the speaker also assumes the
role of teacher in the boarding school, disorienting the colonizer from
places familiar to them in addition to containing them.

The South-facing line continues the reversal of containment, yet this
time the prison and the reservation are invoked:

"To see this space see how you place me in you"

Throughout the poem, "place" and "space" appear in every line, as well
as "see." Yet here, "see" appears twice, suggesting that multiple pairs
of eyes are watching. Goeman writes that "colonial constructions of the
reservation pictured the reservation system as a panoptic space from
which to watch the restless Native, ration resources, and discipline
bodies" (Goeman 82). Goeman's choice of describing the reservation as
panoptic is no mistake given indigenous people are disproportionately
incarcerated, so the echoing "see" in this line suggests not just a
containment but a *de*tainment of the colonizer within a
reservation/prison. The resources rationed by the speaker are freedom,
privacy (the panoptical gaze), and even literacy, given the enclosed
space also invokes the boarding school. Another interesting feature of
the line is the whitespace which immediately follows "this space." The
physical space in the line suggests the speaker is demonstrating the
space or pointing to it (perhaps in the manner of a teacher). This draws
our attention to the space that was also in the East-oriented line: if
the lines in the poem are boundaries, then these spaces could be
potential escapes. But the space shrinks from the East-oriented to the
South-oriented line, suggesting that the opportunity for escape is
closing. The South-oriented line thus provides a chance at freedom for
the colonizer, but in order "To see this space" (that is, the
possibility of escape), the colonizer must "see how you place me in
you". To "see how you place me in you" is precisely to acknowledge the
historical containment of indigenous peoples. Since land as possession
and ownership conflates "human" with "land-owning", "you" metonymically
associates the colonizer with their land, so this sentence is about the
speaker being placed in containment as well as being assimilated.
Further, to "place me in you" is to place "me" away from "me"; that is,
to remove, to displace, and to marginalize just as in the case of the
boarding school.

However, it is imprecise to say that the colonizer is offered escape
from this experiment of containment in exchange for acknowledgement of
past wrongdoings. Rather, they are only tempted with the sight of it:
"To see this space" is not "to pass through" this space. Indeed, when we
reach the West-facing line, we see that the space has vanished:

"This is how to place you in the space in which to see"

"This" points back to the acknowledgement of past containment in the
South-oriented line ("see how you place me in you"). The speaker makes
it clear that this acknowledgement is the precondition for the
West-oriented line, and what this acknowledgement achieves is sight.
This sight is likely empathy, as the "space in which to place me" has
transformed into the "space in which to see". The speaker thus provides
a model for a reversal of containment in order to achieve empathy and
understanding -- the reversal is in service of this empathy, rather than
solely for revenge. Notice that this empathy takes place in the
West-oriented line, which is significant because the West is associated
with the frontier and conquering ostensibly unoccupied land. This line
thus halts further colonial expansion as it demands that the violence of
containment be acknowledged and experienced. The poem does not end in
simplistic harmony; in fact, it does not end at all. Due to its cyclical
nature, this reversal of containment is played over repeatedly,
inscribing the space with words and treating it as a node rather than a
line in which the past fades away and becomes unimportant.

However, the indigenous subject enacting a reversal of containment on
the colonizer is not the only way to read this poem. The poem requests
we entertain multiple readings: the lack of punctuation creates
ambiguity, but also the title itself, "Three", conveys a certain
multiplicity. Perhaps "Three" also invokes the three-dimensional, which
contrasts with the one-dimensional line (land as a linear time
construct) and the two-dimensional, flattened conception of land as pure
possession or ownership. To accept the true three-dimensionality of
land, we must seek alternate ways to read the poem.

Perhaps the speaker's poem is addressed to the self, and the poem then
becomes about experiencing and escaping containment. The text on the
borders, after all, does face inward. The containment of the poem then
becomes an echoing, reflective space, in which the speaker deals with
the damage of containment and of viewing land as property. Goeman writes
that "former principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, Wilma Mankiller,
\[spoke\] to devastating Indian policy that led to the fragmentation of
her people: 'What happened to us at the turn of the century with the
loss of land, when our land was divided out in individual allotments,
had a profound irreversible effect on our people...When we stopped
viewing land ownership in common and viewing ourselves in relation to
owning the land in common, in profoundly altered our sense of community
and our social structure'" (Goeman 78-79). What is crucial about
Mankiller's statement is that the effects are "irreversible", that the
conception of land as property has a lasting legacy. The North-oriented
line of the poem, "This is how you see me the space in which to place
me", then portrays the speaker as they look in the mirror and addresses
the "you", the voice in them that carries this degraded conception of
land. In this reading of the poem, the speaker tries to differentiate
the "you" (the colonial voice) from the "me" (the true self), in an
attempt to liberate the "me". The cyclic nature of the poem suggests
that it is an ongoing process, although not necessarily one that is
endless: the spaces in the East- and South-oriented lines provide room
for escape.

If land is a dialectical, storied site, then it can speak too. In the
conception of land as property, land is an object to be possessed, dead
and silent. But in "Three", the boundaries are words, and so the land
speaks. This reading illuminates the circular, echoing structure
enhanced by the rhyming of "place" and "space": to attempt to contain
land, to attempt to place it within itself, is futile. The land itself
takes issue with its allotment and division into geometric regions, so
"The space in me you see is this place" becomes a frustrated response to
this futile endeavor. The whitespace becomes an exasperated pause, as
the land tries to convey that space-differentiation cannot cause a place
to materialize, since it already exists. Through the multidimensional
readings of this poem, then, we hear a multitude of resistive voices
working to reclaim their conception of land. The indigenous subject
reverses containment onto the colonizer while attempting to move past
damaging conceptions of land through self-reflection, while the land
bears witness and creates its own resistance.
